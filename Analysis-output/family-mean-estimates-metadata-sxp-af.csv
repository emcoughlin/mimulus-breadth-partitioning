"","colname","description"
"1","species","three-letter code for one of ten Mimulus species: cardinalis, parishii, verbenaceus, eastwoodiae, floribundus, norrisii, bicolor, filicaulis, guttatus, or laciniatus"
"2","family","integer representing family in the performance curve models: 1 to number of families in each species"
"3","t.opt","thermal optimum, or temperature at which performance is maximized"
"4","t.pmax","performance maximum along the temperature gradient"
"5","t.cmin","critical thermal minimum, or the lower temperature where performance reaches zero"
"6","t.cmax","critical thermal maximum, or the upper temperature where performance reaches zero"
"7","t.cbreadth","critical breadth for temperature, or tolerance range where performance is above zero across the temperature gradient"
"8","t.breadth","thermal breadth, or span of temperature across which at least 50% of t.pmax is achieved"
"9","t.min","lower thermal limit, or the lower bound of t.breadth (50% threshold)"
"10","t.max","upper thermal limit, or the upper bound of t.breadth (50% threshold)"
"11","t.min2","lower thermal limit, or the lower bound of t.breadth (50% threshold) after being limited to measurement interval"
"12","t.max2","upper thermal limit, or the upper bound of t.breadth (50% threshold) after being limited to measurement interval"
"13","family.orig","family number assigned in original datasets, which is unique across all families: 1 to 306"
"14","range","indicates whether each family is from a widespread or restricted species"
"15","pair","indicates the species pair that each family falls into"
